**Context:**
After the earthquake, we all noticed that so many affected people canâ€™t get noticed easily so others can help them and save their lives. Providing a unified platform to share locations can save lives.
**Requirements:**
User Can share his location or a nearby one with a tag.
Users can see all shared locations.
**Starter Solution (Very simple UI):**
One main page for displaying markers  using flask-googlemaps from a list of locations.
One page for adding a new location
