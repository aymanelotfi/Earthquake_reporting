 ## **Project Overview**:

ZilzalHelp is a web platform designed to streamline post-earthquake relief efforts by enabling affected individuals to share their locations and request assistance. This unified platform empowers others to locate those in need and provide timely aid, potentially saving lives during critical moments. The website was used by hundrends of people in the earthquake.

## **Purpose**

Following a devastating earthquake, locating and assisting affected individuals can be a significant challenge. Communication infrastructure might be disrupted, hindering traditional methods of seeking help. ZilzalHelp aims to bridge this gap by providing a straightforward and accessible platform for:

**Individuals in need:** Easily share their location and a descriptive tag (e.g., "trapped under rubble," "medical attention needed") to raise awareness and expedite rescue efforts.

**Helpers:** Quickly visualize shared locations on a map, prioritize those requiring urgent assistance, and coordinate rescue attempts effectively.

## **Technologies Used:**
Backend: Flask (Python web framework)  due to its flexibility and suitability for rapid prototyping.
Mapping: Flask-GoogleMaps can be used to integrate interactive map visualizations, allowing users to see shared locations in real-time.
Database: A lightweight database  SQLite to  store location data and tags efficiently.

## **Getting started:**
```bash
flask run
```
